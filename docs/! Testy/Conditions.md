Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded), are impairments, but a few, such as [invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Invisible), can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone) condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion)Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's descriptes/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage) on ability checks|
|2|[Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring#Speed) halved|
|3|[Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AdvantageandDisadvantage) on attack rolls and [saving throws](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#SavingThrows)|
|4|Hit point maximum halved|
|5|[Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring#Speed) reduced to 0|
|6|Death|

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its [speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/adventuring#Speed) halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1.
