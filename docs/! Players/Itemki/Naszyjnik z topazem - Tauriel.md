Naszyjnik warty ok 500GP. Znaleziony w szkatułce należącej do Elisabeth Lugosi

----


This topaz necklace would be worth 500 gp to a jeweler unaware of its terrible curse. Lord Strahd immediately knows if you put on the necklace, and his attempts to _scry_ on you automatically succeed. You also have disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed.

**_Curse._** This item is cursed. Once worn, you cannot remove or discard the necklace unless you or the necklace is subject to _remove curse_.

The item was gifted to Elizabeth Lugosi, allowing Strahd to scry on her and keep tabs on her husband. Strahd also used the necklace to charm Elizabeth.
