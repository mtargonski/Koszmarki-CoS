Raven Skull Cane Rapier

The raven cane hides within it a magical rapier (_raven_ rapier) that deals 1d8 + 1 piercing damage and an additional 1d4 radiant damage against undead creatures. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the mechanism to release the rapier hidden within the cane.

 Inscribed on the blade near the hilt are the letters _RR_. The cane once belonged to Rudolph van Richten. The additional radiant damage caused by the _raven rapier_ is only revealed after someone uses the rapier against an undead creature.
