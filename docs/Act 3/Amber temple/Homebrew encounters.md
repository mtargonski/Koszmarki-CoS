mmmm, idk man. Usually by the time any party is able to enter the Amber Temple they're pretty well equipped to utterly wipe the floor with this kind of thing. Could just be me but I would change up the innate spellcasting there to provide 4/day each of mage armor, magic missile & shield.
Then 3/day each of hold person, invisibility & mirror image.
Lastly giving 2/day each of blight, counterspell & fireball as having only one freebie between two of the most popular spells ever would honestly cripple this thing pretty quickly. Having the ability to use up an action to innately cast fireball and then using a reaction to counterspell a counterspell trying to negate the initial effect of the fireball spell cast would aid greatly in giving a party a good run for their money.
