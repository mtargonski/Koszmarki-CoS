I created an NPC in Krezk that was rescued and taken in after (she says) her family was attacked and killed by a group of adventurers months ago.  She becomes the town schoolteacher, and objects to the Baron taking the adventurers in.  
In truth, she is a werewolf scouting out the children to see which among them is the strongest.  During breaks in school, she has them try to push each other out of a circle, and among her personal possessions is a list of children and a rating for each one.  She plans to leave Krezk with this information to lead to a werewolf raid, and she will be able to tell them which children to take. This can help tie your party to the werewolf den if she is discovered. 





I had The Abbot preoccupied with the nature of the Soul, and wanting to study how Souls are bound to bodies, so he could bond Tatyana's soul to Vasilka...

He also didn't understand why he couldn't find it... (it didn't occur to him that she was already incarnated)
