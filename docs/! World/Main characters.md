# Main Characters

The following characters are NPCs who are pivotal to plot of the Legends of Barovia campaign.

## Elder Balan

The last of the old druids, Elder Balan has lived an exceedingly long life yet remains cursed as a villager of Bârgău. He is the wise man of Barovia and knows the valley’s history as well as details about the fey, the Amber Temple, and Strahd. Residing in the hidden village of Bârgău in the snowy mountain pass of Tsolenka, he is a hard man to reach. However, those who seek him out can learn the means to restore Khazan’s memory and gain the blue and red fey gems.

## Ezmerelda

Part Vistani, Ezmerelda is a monster hunter and has led a lonely and dangerous life. She has a few allies, including Muriel Vinshaw, but chooses to remain a lone hunter. Once a confidant and ally of Rudolph van Richten, the famed monster hunter, she fell out his good graces when her history with the Vistani became known. (More on this can be gleaned from Van Richten’s Journal in Van Richten’s Tower.) Although they now walk different paths, their destinies are intertwined thanks to their shared desire to defeat Strahd and all vampires.

## Fey Sisters

The three fey, Water, Forest, and Mountain, were the natural guardians of Barovia long before mortals walked the land. Druids worshipped the fey sisters for a time, but when the first kings arrived with the religion of the Morninglord, the fey were all but forgotten. Strahd eventually learned of their powerful magic and hunted them down and desecrated their remaining shines. Two of the sisters are in hiding, and one is now the cursed Swamp Fey, Baba Lysaga.

### Baba Lysaga

Baba Lysaga is the cursed Swamp Fey. One of the original three fey sisters of Barovia, she was captured by Strahd and escaped. Alone and stripped of her fey magic, she sought out the Dark Powers to defeat Strahd. Instead, the Dark Powers twisted her soul and being, turning her into a hideous and powerful creature. She practices her dark magic in the ruins of Berez, where her army of bullywug minions worship her.

### Madam Eva

Madam Eva appears as an elderly Vistani fortune teller, living among the Tser Pool Vistani clan. In truth, she is the Mountain Fey and is on a centuries-long quest to find adventurers able to restore the fey and defeat Dark Lord Strahd. She will help the PCs and read their fortunes, but she will not reveal herself unless they are able to find her gem and restore her power as the Mountain Fey. Her true identity is one of the greatest secrets in all of Barovia.

### Lila the Midwife-Herbalist

Lila is affectionately known as “the mushroom lady” because she sells village-famous mushroom tea. She appears as a friendly, senile midwife living among the people of Vallaki. They pay her no mind, and she is friendly to all, staying out of the political machinations that permeate the town. In truth, she is the Forest Fey in disguise, keeping a watchful eye out for stout adventures to aid the fey. The only person to know her identity is Muriel Vinshaw.

## Ireena Kolyana

The adopted daughter of the recently deceased burgomaster of Barovia, Ireena is intelligent and well-trained with the blade. Living in the shadow of her father and playing second fiddle to her brother, whom she loves but knows is incapable as a leader, she strives to make a name for herself. However, she unwittingly is also the vessel of Tatyana’s soul, Strahd’s centuries-long obsession. Strahd will do anything to protect Ireena in hopes of winning her love. Strahd is reluctant to charm her, as he would feel cheated out of an opportunity to experience true, reciprocated love.

## Khazan/Exethanter

Khazan was the first wizard guardian of the Amber Temple and was blessed by the fey with exceedingly long life. He faced Strahd at Castle Ravenloft to free the Water Fey imprisoned, only to be struck down and tricked into giving up the secrets of the Amber Temple. His spirit escaped to a phylactery in the Amber Temple, allowing him to return as a lich, albeit without his memory. Now known as Exethanter, Khazan haunts the Amber Temple without any knowledge of his past.

## Ludmilla

Ludmilla is a two-hundred-year-old vampire who is knowledgeable in magic and has obtained dark gifts from the Amber Temple. Previously Strahd’s vampire bride, she secretly plots to overthrow Strahd and become the queen of Barovia. Her secret lair is the old guard tower at the gates of Tsolenka.

## Muriel Vinshaw

A key member of the Keepers of the Feather, Muriel is a master fighter and tactician and the sole descendant of the fabled Vinshaw wereravens, who were entrusted with protecting the green fey gem hidden at the Wizard of Wines vineyard. She is the only person in all Barovia who knows the secret identity of the Forest Fey, Lila the midwife-herbalist in Vallaki. Muriel keeps an eye on the party once they enter Barovia and will only reveal herself if she trusts them. She will report back to the Keepers of the Feather about any new adventures who enter Barovia in case they could become allies.

## Strahd von Zarovich

Strahd, lord of Barovia, has been a vampire for almost four hundred years. He is cursed with immortality and with knowing his horrific acts in his pursuit of power and love. Strahd’s seeks to reunite with the soul of Tatyana, and nothing will stop him from achieving this goal. Strahd often disguises himself as Vasili von Holtz, a minor noble in Vallaki. Not even Vasili’s butler, Bram, knows Vasili’s true identity, which allows Strahd to walk among the people unnoticed. If given the chance, he will pursue Tatyana’s current Barovian incarnation, Ireena, as Vasili. Using teleportation circles in Ravenloft and a secret room in Vasili’s manor, Strahd can travel to and from Vallaki with ease.
