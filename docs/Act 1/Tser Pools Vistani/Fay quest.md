## Card Reading

Madam Eva will lay three cards on the table face down. Each card represents a fey gem location. The cards are preselected. Only the location of the blue gem is random or may be determined beforehand by the DM. 
Madam Eva will reveal the card and state the following.

### Green Gem

> “The green gem of the lovely Forest Fey is strong with the spirits of the animals and birds.”

**Reveal the Raven The Raven**

> “The Raven, how interesting. Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore. Quoth the Raven, ‘Nevermore.’ Not all creatures are what they seem.”

### Red Gem

> “The red gem of the fabled Mountain Fey is powerful indeed. Let us see what the cards reveal.”

**Reveal the 10 of Stars - Master of Stars**

> “Ah, the Master of Stars, the card of a great wizard. Wise men are not wise at all times. Seek the lone tower to learn the location of the red gem.”

### Blue Gem

> “The blue gem is rumored to be lost forever; many have searched for, but to no avail. Tied to the Swamp Fey, it is said, and she, too, seeks it.
> > To destroy evil’s heart
> > You must find its counterpart
> > Last gem you seek
> > The road not for meek
> > Lost its way
> > From its fey
> > The cards will tell
> > Where the gem fell.”

The blue gem is in one of the following locations:

- Abbey
- Argynvostholt
- Gitrog Cave

**Gitrog The Beast**

> “A frog the size of the beast. None know not what it eats!”

**Marina’s Monument The Mists**

!!!!**Ravenloft Donjon
